top  WALTER (Window Arrangement Logic Template Engine for REAPER)

WALTER is a system to define the visual layout and appearance of objects within REAPER -- currently, it can be used to customize the layout and appearance of the REAPER track panels, mixer panels, envelope panels, transport, and so on.

WALTER commands are defined in two places:
In a theme's rtconfig.txt, specifying layout information specific to the theme (for more information on this, see XXX)
In REAPER's Plugins/default_rules.txt, which is used when a theme does not define any WALTER in its rtconfig.txt (such as classic 3.x and 2.x themes)
top  Commands

clear
Clears a particular attribute (or wildcard list of attributes) to empty
Examples:
        clear tcp.mute
        clear tcp.*
reset
Resets a particular attribute (or wildcard list of attributes) to their default settings
Examples:
        reset tcp.mute
        reset tcp.*
set
Sets an attribute or user variable to an expression. For information on what expression can be, see "Expressions" below. Note that you do not need to declare use variables, simply setting them is sufficient. As a matter of etiquette, do not use "." in user variables (although you can), names with "." in them are reserved for future expansion.

Examples:
        set tcp.mute [0 0 10 10]
        set myvar w<100 [0 0 10 10] [20 20 10 10]
        set myvar w<100 [0 0 10 10] w<200 [20 20 10 10] [40 40 10 10]
def
Defines a value to be replaced with another value (e.g. a preprocessor #define). Example:
        def square10 10 10
        set tcp.mute [0 0 square10] ; sets tcp.mute to [0 0 10 10]
        def two_coords [10 10 0 0] [0 0 10 10]
        set tcp.mute + two_coords   ; sets tcp.mute to [10 10 10 10]
        set tcp.mute w<100 two_coords ; like set.tcp.mute w<100 [10 10 0 0] [0 0 10 10]
front
Brings an element to the front of the Z order. Note that the ordering of elements is static and can't be affected by logic. Example (supposing you wanted the mute button to always be above the solo button in the Z order):
        front tcp.solo
        front tcp.mute
macro (REAPER 5.0+)
Defines a macro with any number of parameters which can be used later. Example:
   macro setall dest src
      set dest [src src src src src src src src]
      set master.##dest dest
   endmacro
   setall tcp.mute 1  ; set tcp.mute [1 1 1 1 1 1 1], set master.tcp.mute tcp.mute
Note that using ## in a macro allows the parameter to be concatenated with another named string.


define_parameter (REAPER 6.0+)
Defines a ReaScript-accessible user-defined parameter which the WALTER code can use. The default theme adjuster script will allow tweaking the first 10 parameters. Example:
        ;                variable name     description for user   default  minimum maximum
        define_parameter "hide_mute"       "Hide Mute Button"     0        0       1

        ; later in script, hide tcp.mute if hide_mute is set
        set tcp.mute hide_mute==1 [0]

        ;  note that variable name is used to make the value persist for this theme
custom (REAPER 7.0+)
Defines a custom element. Usage:
  custom tcp.custom.xyz text_label command_id accessibility_description button_image
Note that the custom element name must include the string 'custom.' Custom elements become a normal part of the layout that contains them and can be used with set, front, etc. If command_id is specified and valid, and button_image is a valid image name, element will be a button. Otherwise, it will be a static text element with 'text_label.' tcp.custom.xyz.font .color and .margin may all be specified.

top  Layouts

The above commands can be specified at the top (global) level to control the default layouts. Additionally the author can define layouts, by using the commands "Layout" and "EndLayout". When defining a Layout, it inherits the behavior from the parent (or default) layout (at the time of first use in that UI context -- more on this later, ignore this comment for now).

The Layout command can take one or two paraemeters -- the first parameter defines the name of that layout, and the optional second parameter defines the theme image subdirectory to use for that layout.

Example:

Layout "Mute button mixer"
  clear mcp.*
  set mcp.size [20 20]
  set mcp.mute [0 0 20 20 0 0 1 1]
EndLayout

You can specify multiple Layouts with the same name, and they will be treated similar to a single Layout definiton, though for clarity it might be good to separate them based on the UI context (i.e. tcp.*, mcp.*, etc).

If you define layouts with the same name for various UI contexts, you may wish to expose them as a global theme layout using GlobalLayout, which then lists that layout in the main layout list.

top  Expressions

An expression can be any of the following:
coordinate_list
Coordinate lists are a sequence of values in []s. They represent a sequence of 8 values, and only one is required (any omitted values are set to 0). The meaning of these values depends on context, but for most UI elements the meaning is as follows:
        [0 0 20 20 0 0 1 1]
         ^ ^ ^  ^  ^ ^ ^ ^
         | | |  |  | | | |
         | | |  |  | | | \ bottom attach: scale the bottom edge of control with parent height by this factor
         | | |  |  | | \ right attach: scale the right edge of control with parent width by this factor
         | | |  |  | \ top attach: scale the top edge of control with parent height by this factor
         | | |  |  \ left attach: scale the left edge of control with parent width by this factor
         | | |  \ height: height of control (before edge scaling, if any)
         | | \ width: width of control (before edge scaling, if any)
         | \ top: top edge of control (before edge scaling, if any)
         \ left: left edge of control (before edge scaling, if any)
            
Other uses:
*.size: the left/top coordinates are interpreted as default width/height. The width/height coordinates may specify "minimum sizes" for some contexts (notably tcp, mcp, envcp, etc). These minimum sizes aren't necessarily enforced in the UI, but instead it is kept larger with a "you're not seeing everything" image overlayed.
*.margin: the first four coordinates represent left, top, right, bottom margins, respectively, and the fifth coordinate represents (when supported) where to justify text (0=left,0.5=center,1=right)
*.color, the first four coordinates represent red, green, blue, and alpha (0-255), and the second four coordinates may specify another color (or may be ignored).
Additionally, some fields may use the values in other ways (as documented).


scalar_value
You can use a scalar_value as an expression in the following ways:
Specifying the scalar name/value directly -- in this case, all values in the coordinate_list get this value. For example:
   set foo 1.0
     and
   set foo [1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0]
...or
   set foo h
     and
   set foo [h h h h h h h h]
 
are equivalent.
You can specify a scalar as a sparse coordinate_list by using the following syntax:
   scalar@x or scalar@0
   scalar@y or scalar@1
   scalar@w or scalar@2
   scalar@h or scalar@3
   scalar@ls or scalar@4
   scalar@ts or scalar@5
   scalar@rs or scalar@6
   scalar@bs or scalar@7
For example, the following are equivalent:
   set foo 1.0@w
     and
   set foo [0 0 1.0 0]
...or
   set foo recarm@w
     and
   set foo [0 0 recarm 0]
As a shorthand for making a sparse coordinate_list from one value of a coordinate_list, "coordlist{x}@x" can be abbreviated as "coordlist@x".


operator_string expression optional_expression
If operator_string is specified, it can contain simple expressions, and allows you to either choose or combine the following expressions. The format of operator_string is one of the following (val1/val2 can be constant or scalar_value variables, see comment below) -- note the lack of spaces in the string:
Comparisons:
        val1<val2     --   if val1 is less than val2, use first expression, otherwise second
        val1>val2     --   if val1 is greater than val2 ...
        val1<=val2     --   if val1 is less than or equal to val2, use first expression, otherwise second
        val1>=val2     --   if val1 is greater than or equal to val2 ...
        val1==val2    --   if val1 equals val2 ...
        val1!=val2    --   if val1 does not equal val2 ...
        ?val1         --   if val1 is nonzero ...
        !val1         --   if val1 is zero ...
        val1&val2     --   bitwise AND (if any bit is set in both val1 and val2)

Combinators:
        +             --   sum first expression and second expression
        -             --   subtract second expression from first expression  (REAPER 5.0+)
        *             --   multiply first expression and second expression
        /             --   divide first expression by second expression (REAPER 5.0+)
        +:val1:val2   --   val1*(first expression) + val2*(second expression)
        *:val1:val2   --   ((first expression)+[val1 val1...])*((second expression)+[val2 val2...])
 
If optional_expression is not specified, then in its place will be the current value of the destination, which can also be abbreviated as "." -- so, for example, the following commands are all compiled to the same logic:
  set var w<100 [0]
  set var w<100 [0] .
  set var w<100 [0] var
            
Finally, you can extend expressions (which are often nested and thus quite long) over multiple lines by ending each line (except the last) with a backslash ("\")(requires v4.25+).

top  Scalar Values

scalar: adjective: capable of being represented by a point on a scale (a single value, as compared to a coordinate_list)

Scalar values in WALTER are generally read-only, meaning you cannot create scalar variables (though you can use coordinate_lists and read their values if needed).
predefined scalar variables: these are variables which can be used in operator_string, or used directly as values in expressions The variables are:
        w                 -- width of parent, pixels
        h                 -- height of parent, pixels
        reaper_version    -- REAPER version (i.e. 4.25)(requires v4.15+)
        os_type           -- (REAPER 5.972+) - set to 0 on Windows, 1 on macOS, 2 on Linux

Track specific:
        folderstate       -- folder state of track, if applicable (0 for normal, 1 for folder, 
                             -n for last track in folder(s))
        folderdepth       -- positive if in a folder (how many folders deep)
        maxfolderdepth    -- highest folder depth of any track
        mcp_maxfolderdepth -- highest folder depth of any track in mixer(requires v4.15+)
        recarm            -- nonzero if track record armed
        tcp_iconsize      -- size of track panel icon column, if any
        mcp_iconsize      -- size of mixer icon row, if any
        mcp_wantextmix    -- flags indicating which extended mixer settings are desired 
                             (&1 for inserts, &2 for sends, &4 for fx parms)
        tracknch          -- number of track channels (2-64)
        trackpanmode      -- pan mode of track (0=classic 3.x, 3=new balance, 5=stereo pan, 6=dualpan)
        tcp_fxparms       -- count of TCP FX parameters visible (0-n) (including sends or FX items, if visible)
        tcp_fxembed       -- (REAPER 6.0+) - count of TCP embedded FX visible
        mcp_fxembed       -- (REAPER 6.38+) count of MCP embedded FX visible
        tcp_sends_enabled -- (REAPER 7.0+) user preference to show sends in TCP is enabled
        tcp_fxlist_enabled -- (REAPER 7.0+) user preference to show FX inserts in TCP is enabled
        send_cnt          -- (REAPER 7.0+) number of sends
        fx_parm_cnt       -- (REAPER 7.0+) number of FX parameters
        fx_cnt            -- (REAPER 7.0+) number of FX inserts
        recfx_cnt         -- (REAPER 7.0+) number of record input FX
        trackcolor_valid  -- (REAPER 5.0+) - set to 1 if track color set
        trackcolor_r      -- (REAPER 5.0+) - valid if trackcolor_valid set, red value 0-255
        trackcolor_g      -- (REAPER 5.0+) - valid if trackcolor_valid set, green value 0-255
        trackcolor_b      -- (REAPER 5.0+) - valid if trackcolor_valid set, blue value 0-255
        mixer_visible     -- (REAPER 5.972+) - set to 1 if the mixer is visible
        track_selected    -- (REAPER 5.972+) - set to 1 if track is selected
        trackidx          -- (REAPER 6.47+) track index (0 for master, 1+)
        ntracks           -- (REAPER 6.47+) total track count (not including master)
        trackfixedlanes   -- (REAPER 7.0+) number of fixed lanes (or 0)

Transport specific:
        trans_flags       -- trans_flags&1 is nonzero if transport centered
                             trans_flags&2 is nonzero if user wants playspeed controls visible
                             trans_flags&4 is nonzero if user wants current time signature visible
        trans_docked      -- nonzero if docked transport
        trans_center      -- nonzero if transport centered

Envelope specific:
        envcp_type        -- 4 if FX envelope (can display additional controls)
        env_selected      -- (REAPER 7.0+) set to 1 if envelope is selected
accessing scalar components of coordinate_list/expressions:
A coordinate_list is composed of 8 scalar values, as described above. To convert from a named coordinate_list to a scalar value, you can use the following syntax:
   set tmp [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
   tmp{x} or tmp{0}  -- first item in coordinate_list (1)
   tmp{y} or tmp{1}
   tmp{w} or tmp{2}
   tmp{h} or tmp{3}
   tmp{ls} or tmp{4}
   tmp{ts} or tmp{5}
   tmp{rs} or tmp{6}
   tmp{bs} or tmp{7}  -- last item in coordinate_list (8)
So, in the above example, you can specify "tmp{y}" anywhere you would otherwise use "2". For example, instead of
  set foo w>2 [1] [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
you could specify
  set foo w>tmp{y} [1] [0 1 tmp{y} 3 4 5 6 7]
Note: in the context of using coordinate_list names inside of [] coordinate_list, if the {} index is omitted, the current index will be used, i.e. the following are the same:
  set tmp [1 2 3 4]
  set foo [0 0 tmp tmp]
    and
  set foo [0 0 tmp{2} tmp{3}]




top  Edge Attachment Coordinates

For coordinate_lists that define a position, the 5th-8th items in a coordinate_list are used to specify "edge attachment". This controls how the position/size of the item changes in relation to changes of the parent size. These values are usually within 0..1, where 0 means that a change in the parent size does not affect a change in this coordinate, and 1 means that a change in the parent size changes this coordinate similarly, and 0.5 means that an increase of 2 pixels in the parent size will increase this coordinate by 1.

For other types (fonts, margins), the meanings of these items is specific to those types.
